## Backend Setup

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
4. The backend will run on port 3000 by default. In Codespaces, make sure port 3000 is public and use the provided URL to access the backend API.

If you need to install Express or CORS manually, run:
```bash
npm install express cors
```

If you are testing this on your own codespace make sure after you do these steps to make your backend port public so you can get info from it.
